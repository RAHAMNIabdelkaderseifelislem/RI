# What's Computer Networks?

Computer Networks is a set of computers connected together to share resources and data.

# Computer Networks Equipments

are all the devices that are used to build a computer network.

## Repeaters

are used to amplify the signal. They are used to extend the range of a network.

## Hubs

are used to connect multiple devices together. They are used to extend the range of a network.
there are 3 types of hubs:

### Passive hubs

are used to connect multiple devices together. They can only share the signal, they can't amplify it.

### Active hubs

are used to connect multiple devices together. They can amplify the signal.

### Smart hubs

are used to connect multiple devices together. They can amplify the signal and they can filter the signal.

## Bridges

are used to connect multiple devices together. bridges are like repeaters but they are more intelligent.

## Switches

are used to connect multiple devices together. switches are like bridges but have more ports so they can connect more devices.

## Routers

are used to connect multiple networks together. Routers are like switches but they can connect multiple networks.

# Computer Networks Topologies

are the way the devices are connected together.

they are devide in 2 categories:

## Physical Topologies

are the way the devices are connected together physically. like the following:

### Bus Topology

is a topology where all the devices are connected to a single cable.

### Star Topology

is a topology where all the devices are connected to a central device.

### Ring Topology

is a topology where all the devices are connected to each other in a ring.

### Extended Star Topology

is a topology where all the devices are connected to a central device and to each other. it's a combination of the star and the bus topology.

### Mesh Topology

is a topology where all the devices are connected to each other. it's a combination of the star and the ring topology.

## Logical Topologies

are the way the devices are connected together logically. like the following:

### Peer-to-Peer Topology

is a topology where all the devices are connected to each other.

### Client-Server Topology

is a topology where all the devices are connected to a central device.

# Computer Networks Protocols

there are set of rules that are used to communicate between devices.

# Types of Computer Networks

there are 3 types of computer networks:

## LAN

stands for Local Area Network. it's a network that is used to connect multiple devices together in a small area.

## MAN

stands for Metropolitan Area Network. it's a network that is used to connect multiple devices together in a medium area.

## WAN

stands for Wide Area Network. it's a network that is used to connect multiple devices together in a large area.

# Bandwidth and throughput

## Bandwidth

is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted in a given time.

## Throughput

is the actual amount of data that is transmitted in a given time.

# Diffrence between peer-to-peer and client-server

## Peer-to-Peer

is a network where all the devices are connected to each other. so all devices can be a server and a client.

## Client-Server

is a network where all the devices are connected to a central device. so all devices can be a client but only the central device can be a server.
